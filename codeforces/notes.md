My first solved exercise on Codeforces! Yay.
Extremely easy. Most of the time I took was learning the basic syntax for cpp.
I had no idea that there are basic optimizations that can be used to speed up basic
io functionality. I'll build a basic template file, and I'll use it going forward.
I did use a map for my solution, but a much better solution would be to use an array
of 26 elements (to keep track of solved problems from A to Z).
