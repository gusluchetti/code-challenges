## keeping track of solved code challenges

it's been one of my goals to get better at solving programming problems, so besides
'Advent of Code' every now and then, i'd like to keep solved solutions for any other
websites that offer coding problems. As of now, that includes:  

- Codeforces
- Leetcode

Wish me luck!
